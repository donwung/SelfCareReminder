# SelfCareReminder
A small app to help maintain a little bit of mindfulness.

First time working in WinForms (I think I like it better than Tkinter).

# Overview
Somedays, you forget that you're a little too glued to your monitor.

So I've created this little application to help be a bit more mindful.

By default, every minute, this app will pop open a small speech bubble with a few phrases to simply just remind you to be a bit mindful and take a little break away from your screen to do important tasks like drinking water or stretching.
